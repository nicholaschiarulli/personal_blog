## Recipe

- 11-12 grams of coffee
- 200ml of filtered water (Berkey filter)
- paper filter

## Tools

- Aeropress
- Kettle for boiling water
- Timemore C2 manual coffee grinder (I use the max version) or you can choose another coffee grinder but I would recommend one with a steel burr
- Coffee scale to measure the grams (I use an electric one)
- Measuring cup for water

## Technique

1. First measure out the beans you are going to use 11-12 grams
2. Transfer the grounds to your coffee grinder
3. Grind to medium fine (15 clicks on the timemore c2)
4. Put the paper filter in the aeropress
5. Transfer the grounds on top of the paper filter
6. Place the aeropress over a cup or mug (whatever is sturdy and can hold roughly 250-300ml of water)
7. Boil your water 200ml
8. When the water is boiling, take the kettle of water and pour it into the aeropress intially trying to wet as much of the grounds as you can and after the grounds are submerged just pour the rest stright in
10. Take the aeropress cap / pushing device and cover the top containing the coffee and water keep it there for 2 minutes
11. After 2 minutes pick up the mug and aeropress together and do a **GENTLE** swirl to mix the coffee and water up
12. Now wait another 30 seconds
13. After that 30 seconds press lightly for 30 seconds
14. Your coffee should be finished and ready to drink after cooling off
