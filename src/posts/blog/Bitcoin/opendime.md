## It is Bitcoin Cash (Not to be confused with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain)

Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin like a dollar bill. Pass it along multiple times. Connect to any USB to check balance. Unseal anytime to spend online. Trust no one.

## USB DRIVE

Acts like a read-only USB flash drive. Works with any computer, laptop, or phone. A QR Image and Text files inside contain Bitcoin address and helpful information.

## NO TRUST

Give an Opendime to anyone and they don't need to worry that you can take back the funds later. The private key is strictly in the device itself.

## ULTRA SECURE

The private key is generated inside the device, and is never known to any human, not even you! Also, once it is unsealed, a permanent change is made inside the flash memory of the processor. This means it is safe from someone knowing the private key before exchanging.

## Verifiable

There are a number of ways to verify the device; first, you can click on a link shown in the index.htm file present on the device. That link includes a signed message, that only an Opendime with access to the private key can generate. With version 2 products (rounded type) there is a factory key which can be verified with using the factory public key. This proves the hardware was produced by Opendime.

With the newest hardware (V2), there is a dedicated anti-counterfeiting chip which holds a secret key assigned by the Opendime factory. Opendime publishes the matching public key, and so it's easy to verify that you have a genuine Opendime in your hands.

## FREE TO USE

This is physical Bitcoin as it was meant to be: just hand it to someone and they've got it. Pass it on multiple times! As simple as a handshake. No miner fees, no confirmation delays.

## OPEN STANDARDS

Uses Bitcoin message signing, normal (non HD) bitcoin payment addresses and private keys in WIF format.

## BASED ON PRIVATE KEYS

Each Opendime holds one private key. It publishes the public key (payment address) to anyone and never reveals the key until "unsealed".

## PIGGY-BANK ECONOMICS

Yes. It's like a piggy-bank. You must destroy it to spend the funds. At first that seems expensive and wasteful, but it's a key part of our security model: you can trust a sealed Opendime, and it's obvious when it's been opened.

## INSTANT AND OFF-CHAIN

Since private keys are put into a physical form you can trust, you can simply hand around Opendime units to move amounts around. There are no pre-defined Bitcoin amounts with Opendime either. Store as much or as little as needed.

## Private

Opendime transactions are a little different from blockchain transactions: Whenever two people meet and trade goods or services for an Opendime, you could say a transaction has occurred, and yet there is nothing recorded on the blockchain. This is different from a normal Bitcoin wallet which makes blockchain records continuously, and can create a complex web of connections which can later be explored by anyone.
