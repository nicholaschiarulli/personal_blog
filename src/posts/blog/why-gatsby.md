### 3. Access to GraphQL
Gatsby comes with built in support for GraphQL. GraphQL allows you to query to your API and get exactly what you need Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.
### 4. Easy use of Markdown
Here's the simple steps
- Read files into Gatsby from the filesystem
- Transform Markdown to HTML and frontmatter to data
- Add a Markdown file
- Create a Collection Route component for the Markdown files
### 5. SEO
