## Recipe

- 47-50 grams of coffee
- 700ml of filtered water (Berkey filter if available)
- Remember a ml equals a gram

## Tools

- Chemex
- Paper chemex filters
- Kettle for boiling water
- Timemore C2 manual coffee grinder (I use the max version) or you can choose another coffee grinder but I would recommend one with a steel burr. If you do have this grinder I do about 18 clicks (medium coarse)
- Coffee scale to measure the grams (I use an electric one)

## Technique

1. First measure out the beans you are going to use 47-50 grams on the scale
2. Transfer the grounds to your coffee grinder
3. Grind to medium coarse (18 clicks on the timemore c2)
4. Put the paper filter in the chemex
5. Begin boiling a small amount of water. This is to wet the paper filter to take the paper taste away
6. Once water is boiled, begin to dampen the chemex filter all around.
7. Dump out the water in the chemex into the sink or a bowl.
8. Weigh out 700 ml (grams) of filtered water and then put that in your kettle and boil it.
9. While the water is boiling, transfer the grounds on top of the paper filter and give it a shake to even out the grounds
10. Place chemex with coffee grounds in the paper filter on your scale and then tare.
11. Once water is finished boiling begin to pour gently from the center in swirls all around the coffee bed (100ml)
12. Wait 45 seconds
13. Begin to pour gently again with the same technique (200ml)
14. Wait 45 seconds again
15. Begin to pour gently for the third time with the same technique (200ml)
16. Wait 1 minute and 30 seconds
17. Begin to pour gently for the last time with the same technique (200ml)
18. Let the filtering process finish (could take a couple minutes)
19. Your coffee should be finished and ready to drink after cooling off!
