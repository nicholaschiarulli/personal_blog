## Supplies

- 10 grams of each coffee
- 150 grams of filtered water (Berkey filter if available) for each cup 300 grams total
- Coffee scale to measure the grams and water
- Timer (if your scale does not have one)
- Coffee grinder. I prefer a manual one, especially when only tasting two coffees
- 2 cups large enough to hold roughly 200 ml, can use a nice measuring cup or a glass
- Kettle, preferably electric (doesn't matter too much) at 200 degrees
- 2 spoons
- Separate cup with hot water to rinse the spoon
- Separate cup / bowl to hold used coffee grounds

## What to taste / smell for

None of these are necessarily negative or posituve, we are aiming for a cup of coffee that tastes good and these are helpful things to look out for when tasting.

- Aroma intensity
- Acidity
- Bitterness
- Sweetness
- Body weight/viscosity on the tongue
- Finish / Aftertaste
- Flavor

## Technique

1. Measure 10 grams of the first coffee.
2. Grind each coffee to a coarse setting, it should look similar to coarse sea salt. (18 clicks on the timemore c2)
3. Put the coffee sample into one of the cups.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the other coffee you're testing.
5. Heat your water up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. A little less than boiling if you do not have access to temperature measurements.
6. Start your timer, and begin pouring 150 grams of water into each bowl.
7. Take a smell of the coffee.
8. At 4 minutes, start to break the crust. To do this, use a spoon to push the coffee grounds to the back of the cup. Make sure you rinse the spoon between each cup and after in hot water.
9. Using two spoons, remove the remaining coffee grounds and foam from the cups and put them in a cup for used coffee grounds.
10. Let the coffee cool and start tasting in 12 - 15 mins.
11. It is recommended to slurp the coffee to cover more area on your tongue.
12. Make sure to rinse the spoon between tasting.
